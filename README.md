# Library-system
This library system allows the user to search, checkout and return books using a GUI (tkinter). This project was developed using python 3 and it is structured into different modules. The booksearch module allows the user to search for a book by its title. The modules bookcheckout and bookreturn allows the user to checkout a book or return it. The bookweed module allows the library manager to remove a book from the database, this module suggests which book should be removed. Finally the menu module uses the tkinter library for the GUI.
